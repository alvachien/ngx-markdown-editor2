# NgxMarkdownEditor2
Another Markdown editor for Angular.

# Why
It's hardly to find a suitable Markdown based editor which supports Math and can be used in Angular world.
The last chance here is, write a new one.

The project learning a lot from the following projects:
- Editor.md [Link](https://github.com/pandao/editor.md). It is a jQuery based implementation of Markdown editor.
- Vditor [Link](https://github.com/b3log/vditor). Though it is written by Typescript, it depends onn its own CDN and more like a product than a reusable component. Besides, it have heavy dependence with its own Markdown engine.
- NgxMarkdownEditor [Link](https://github.com/lon-yang/ngx-markdown-editor). It relys on ACE, and it don't support Math. 
- Pell [Link](https://github.com/jaredreich/pell). Though it isn't a markdown editor, it's idea behind is quite useful.
